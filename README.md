### Hi there, the name's Sam. I'm an Ex-Montessori kindergarten teacher, now passionate software developer ðŸ‘‹
### I'm currently studying in Helsinki, preparing myself for my first leap into the world of professional programming!

### As you can see above, my projects have mostly been in C. Whilst somewhat narrow in language, the skills learned from our projects can be carried throughout my development journey, and I'm so excited to explore new languages and technologies along the way.
